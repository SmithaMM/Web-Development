        <u>Nature is part of our life</u> . We grew out of the seed, the earth, and we are part of all that, but we are rapidly losing the sense that we are animals like the others. Can you have a feeling for a tree, look at it, see the beauty of it,
        listen to the sound it makes? Can you be sensitive to the little plant, a little weed, to that creeper growing up the wall, to the light on the leaves and the many shadows? One must be aware of all this and have that sense of communion with nature
        around you. You may live in a town, but you do have trees here and there. A flower in the next garden may be ill-kept, crowded with weeds, but look at it, feel that you are part of all that, part of all living things. <b>If you hurt nature, you are hurting yourself.</b>        </p>

    <p style="background-color: rgb(114, 179, 154);">One knows all this has been said before in different ways, but we donâ€™t seem to pay much attention. Is it that we are so caught up in our own network of problems, our desires, our urges of pleasure and pain that we never look around, never watch the
        moon? <big>Watch it</big> . <small>Watch with all your eyes and ears, your sense of smell.</small> Watch. Look as though you are looking for the first time. If you can do that, you see for the first time that tree, bush or blade of grass. Then
        you can see your teacher, your mother or father, your brother or sister, for the first time. There is an extraordinary feeling about that: the wonder, the strangeness, the miracle of a fresh morning that has never been before and never will be.</p>
